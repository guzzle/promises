# Guzzle Promises

`guzzlehttp/promises` is a small promise library used by Guzzle for asynchronous
operations. It implements promise chaining, synchronous waiting, cancellation,
and helpers for working with groups of promises.

Most application developers use this package through
[`guzzlehttp/guzzle`](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/8.0/README.md) by
calling methods such as `requestAsync()`. Install this package directly when you
need promise composition without the full HTTP client.

## Installation

```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/promises
```

## Version Guidance

| Version | Status       | PHP Version  |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| 3.0     | Latest       | >=7.4,<8.6   |
| 2.5     | Maintenance  | >=7.2.5,<8.6 |
| 1.5     | End of Life  | >=5.5,<8.3   |

## Quick Start

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Promise\Promise;
use GuzzleHttp\Promise\Utils;

$promise = new Promise();

$promise->then(
    function ($value) {
        echo 'Fulfilled: ' . $value;
    },
    function ($reason) {
        echo 'Rejected: ' . $reason;
    }
);

$promise->resolve('done');
Utils::queue()->run();
```

You can wait for a promise to complete synchronously:

```php
$value = $promise->wait();
```

When using Guzzle HTTP requests, asynchronous methods return
`GuzzleHttp\Promise\PromiseInterface` instances:

```php
$promise = $client->requestAsync('GET', 'https://example.com');
$response = $promise->wait();
```
